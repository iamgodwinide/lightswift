              would be illegal or otherwise violate any applicable law. You
              represent and warrant that you are not a citizen or resident of
              any such jurisdiction and that you will not use any Services while
              located in any such jurisdiction. You also may not use the

              other jurisdiction where LightSwift has determined, at its
              discretion, to prohibit use of the Services (USA etc.). LightSwift
              may implement controls to restrict access to the Services from any
              jurisdiction prohibited pursuant to this Section. You will comply
              with this Section, even if LightSwift methods to prevent use of
              the Services are not effective or can be bypassed. <br />We
              reserve the right to use “geo-blocking”, that is, we may block by

              Each Customer may have different transactional limits for
              different reasons. <br />If a Customer is suspected of using
              multiple accounts to override the daily or weekly transactional
              limits, that shall be reason by the Company to suspend all of
              implicated accounts from the Service. <br />You are not allowed to
